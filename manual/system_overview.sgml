<title>System Overview</>

<para>Each Coda client sees the Coda File System as a single tree, <filename>/coda</>.  In reality this tree is an illusion supported by <firstterm>System Control Machine</> (<acronym>SCM</>), several dedicated file servers, and a local area network.  One of the servers may double as the (SCM).  <xref linkend="ServerOrg"> illustrates the server organization.  </para>

<title>Machines</>

<para>The Coda architecture recognizes three types of machines, <firstterm>clients</>, <firstterm>servers</> and a <firstterm>system control machine</> (or <acronym>SCM</>). Client machines are typically single-user workstations used to access shared information.  These machines are not trusted by servers except for the duration of a login session by an authenticated user. Server machines are secure, trusted machines whose purpose is to service client requests for shared data.  As the custodians of shared information, servers must require authentication of each user before releasing shared data to the users client workstation.  The third machine type is the system control machine  (SCM).  The purpose of the SCM is to provide a single point of control for ease of administration.  Logically, the SCM is distinct from the servers, but, physically, the SCM can also act as a server.  </para>

<sect1>
<title>Processes</>

<para>Each of the dedicated file servers must run a number of processes. These processes are shown in <xref linkend="ServerOrgT"> and are described below.  </para>

<table id=ServerOrgT frame=none>
<title>Server processes</>
<tgroup cols=2>
<tbody>
<row>
<entry>File Server Process</entry>
<entry>The <application>codasrv</> process interacts with the venus process on clients.  Together they fulfill user requests for shared data stored on the server.   When started, the server process will salvage the file system.   The presence of a file called <filename>SHUTDOWN</> in the <filename>/vice/srv</> directory indicates that the server process exited normally. </entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry>Auth Server Process</entry>
<entry>The <application>auth2</> process runs on all servers.  It validates user passwords and issues a token for that user if the password is correct.   However, passwords may only be changed at the SCM.  Hence,  the password database is read-only replicated to all servers and the SCM maintains the read-write replica.  Changes to the password file are updated automatically through the <application>updateclnt/updatesrv</> processes described below.  On all servers (except the SCM), auth2 is invoked with the <option>-chk</> option.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry>Update Client Process</entry>
<entry> The <application>updateclnt</> process works in conjunction with the <application>updatesrv</> process (running on the SCM) to keep read-only copies of system files and databases in sync with their corresponding read-write copy.  The updateclnt process checks with the updatesrv process on the SCM periodically to ensure that the read-only copy on this server is the latest copy.  Thus, when the read-write copy is updated, the read-only copies will be automatically updated after some delay.  </entry>

<title>Data Location</>

<para>The information stored on Coda servers is organized into several directories.  These directories are are described below.  </para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para><filename>/vice/auth2</filename> This directory contains information related to the authentication process, including its log file.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><filename>/usr/sbin</filename> contains the Coda file system binaries for servers and the SCM.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><filename>/vice/db</filename> contains the log file for the update processes as well as a number of databases important to servers.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><filename>/vice/srv</filename> contains information related to the server process, including its log file.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><filename>/vice/vol</filename> contains information related to the volumes contained in the Coda file system.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><filename>/vice/vol/remote</filename> exists only on the SCM and contains volume information for all remote servers.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><filename>/vice/misc</filename> is where the updateclnt and updatesrv
processes live and store their logfiles.</para>
</listitem>
