<chapt> Kernels for use with Coda <p>

Currently, Coda clients and servers, can only be run on Mach kernels. The servers
can be run on vanilla Mach kernels, but the clients require some Coda-specific
changes to be made to the kernel. The Mach X126 release includes the coda
kernel changes under the EXP configuration flag.  Thus running a facilities
kernel named X126.STD+WS+EXP (or something similar with the +EXP suffix) should
allow you to run a Coda Venus.

<sect>Vnode Interface<p>
In Unix systems, the piece of code which translates user-generated system calls
into file system requests is called the Vnode Interface. To integrate with this
interface, a file system must provide a driver for the routines in the interface.
For Coda, this driver is called the <em>MiniCache.</em>

Since Venus is a user-level process, frequent interaction
between Venus and the Vnode Interface would severely reduce the
performance of Coda.  In order to reduce this load, there is a cache,
called the <em>MiniCache</em>, between Venus and the Vnode Interface.  The
MiniCache improves Codas performance by reducing the need to interact
with the Vnoce Interface.

Communication between Venus and the MiniCache is obtained through a Unix
special device. On Coda machines, this device is called /dev/cfs0. This file
must be created as part of the client installation.

<sect>Installing the Coda kernel<p>
The Mach kernel with Coda changes only needs to be installed on client machines.
See the section on client installation for this procedure.
