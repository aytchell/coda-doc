<chapt> Common Problems and Suggestions			<label id="Problems">
<p>							<!-- Appendix III -->

<descrip>
<tag><bf><tt>ls /coda</tt> fails</bf></tag>If the return code is either 
"Invalid Argument" or "No Device", venus was probably restarted recently 
and hasn't yet finished initializing. Solution:  Wait a few minutes a try again.
<tag><bf>Newly created volume is</bf></tag> If a newly created volume, when mounted
<bf>dangling link</bf>for the first time, shows up as a dangling symbolic 
link (it looks inconsistent), the problem is that new databases have 
not been distributed to the other replication sites.  Solution:  Unmount 
the volume, wait five minutes and try again. You'll have to reinitialize 
the venus which failed to find the volume, since VLDB information 
cant be flushed.
<tag>
<bf>Venus Fails on Startup with</bf> </tag>There exists a process with an reference to a file in /coda. Its
<bf>"unable to unmount" message</bf>either a running process <bf>cd</bf>-ed into <tt>/coda</tt> To solve
the problem, either get the process out of /coda (in case its
a shell) or kill it the process. If you cant find the right process
rebooting the workstation should clear it up.
<tag>
<bf>Venus error messages fail to print on console window of window manager</bf></tag>Use the <em>-console filename</em> option to <bf>startcodav</bf> on startup.
This will force stderr messages to print to the specified file.
 Use <bf>tail -f filename</bf> in a window to observe any error messages.
<tag>
<bf>Rvm gets Trashed</bf></tag><bf>ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT</bf>
If Rvm gets trashed -- it asserts, wont recover, there are many failures
on salvage, dumpvm fails -- there are probably serious <bf>venus</bf> or <bf>srv</bf>
bugs which must be fixed. Talk to Coda experts before continuing!!!
<tag>
<bf>Performing the following actions will result in the loss of ALL Coda file system data.</bf></tag>

Reinitializing the RVM Data segment (i.e. with rdsinit)
Reinitializing the RVM Log (i.e. with rvmutl)
Rewriting or trashing the file containing the Log or Data segment.
