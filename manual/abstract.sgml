The <em>Coda File System</em> is a descendant of the <em>Andrew File
System.</em>  Like AFS, Coda offers location-transparent access to a shared
Unix file namespace that is mapped on to a collection of dedicated file
servers.  But Coda represents a substantial improvement over AFS because it
offers considerably higher availability in the face of server and network
failures.  The improvement in availability is achieved using the
complementary techniques of <em>server replication</em> and <em>disconnected
operation.</em> Disconnected operation proven especially valuable in
supporting portable computers.  This document is a reference manual for Coda
users and system administrators.
