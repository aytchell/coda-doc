<para>The <emphasis>Coda File System</> is a descendant of the <emphasis>Andrew File System.</>  Like AFS, Coda offers location-transparent access to a shared Unix file namespace that is mapped on to a collection of dedicated file servers.  But Coda represents a substantial improvement over AFS because it offers considerably higher availability in the face of server and network failures.  The improvement in availability is achieved using the complementary techniques of <firstterm>server replication</> and <firstterm>disconnected operation.</> Disconnected operation proven especially valuable in supporting portable computers.  This document is a reference manual for Coda users and system administrators.  </para>
