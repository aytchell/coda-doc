<chapt> Troubleshooting <p>

This chapter is meant to help solve some of the problems you may run
into when using Coda.  

<sect>File System Full<p>
You may get a message of the form, <em>/usr: file system
full</em> when you have not put any extra data on that disk.  If the
venus.cache directory is on that disk, that is probably your problem.
You can execute euther <em>cfs flushobject &lt;object&gt;</em> or <em>cfs
flushvolume &lt;dir&gt;</em> to try to free up some disk space.  <bf>Be carful
when flushing anything while disconnected.  You will lose any changes
that you made</bf>.  In the long term, the cache size in
<em>/usr/coda/etc/vstab</em> is proabably too large for the disk and should
be made smaller.
