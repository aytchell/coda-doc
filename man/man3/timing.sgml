<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>
This package may be used to time sections of a program.  Time values are
noted by placing  probes in the code at points specified by the user. At each
probe location a time value is obtained from a timer. These recorded time
values are used to compute the times elapsed between consecutive probes.  
As an additional feature, for multiple runs of the same program, the package
provides first and second order statistics for the elapsed time between
consecutive probes.  This package only works for timing experiments that take
less than 35 minutes to run.


<!--1 line-->
The package is used by calling the following routines: 

<descrip>
<tag><em>ti_init ()</em></tag> initialises the timer. 
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><em>ti_create ()</em></tag> allocates storage for n entries, where n corresponds to the total number of times ti&lowbar;notetime () is called.
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><em>ti_notetime ()</em></tag> probes are placed in different
sections of the code by calling ti_notetime ().  Each probe has to be
given a unique id number. In order for the program to function correctly it
is necessary that a probe with id 0 is placed at the very beginning of the
code being timed.
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><em>ti_postprocess ()</em></tag> the times obtained from all the
ti_notetime () calls are processed by the ti&lowbar;postprocess ()
routine. The ti_postprocess () routine can produce the time at each
probe with respect to either the very first probe (twrt = BASELINE) or the
previous probe (twrt = DELTA).
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><em>ti_discoverpaths ()</em></tag> for multiple
iterations of the code being timed, different paths might be followed each
time.  A path corresponds to a set of ids beginning with 0, such as 
(0 1 2, 0 1 4).  ti_discoverpaths identifies all the different paths traversed,
the number of times each path was traversed and other relevant information.  
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><em>ti_stat ()</em></tag> for each path traversed by the program, ti&lowbar;stat provides the user with useful statistics (such as mean and standard deviation), for the elapsed time between probes.
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><em>ti_destroy ()</em></tag> frees the storage used by the package.
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><em>ti_end ()</em></tag> releases the timer.
<P></descrip>




<mansect>DIAGNOSTICS<P>
All successful calls return 0.  Negative return values indicate errors.  In particular -2 is returned by ti_postprocess if the experiment runs more than 35 minutes.



<mansect>EXAMPLE<P>

  for (i=0; i&lt;iterations; i++)
  &lcub;
    ti_notetime (&amp;array&lowbar;info, 0);
    ti_notetime (&amp;array&lowbar;info, 1);
    for (j=0; j&lt;10; j++)
    &lcub;
      foo = foo +j;
    &rcub;

    ti_notetime (&amp;array&lowbar;info, 2);
