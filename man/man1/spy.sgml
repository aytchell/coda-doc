<mansect>NAME 
 <P>spy - Report all CFS files that are opened



<mansect>SYNOPSIS<P>
<bf>spy</bf> &lsqb; -host &lt;hostname&gt; &rsqb; &lsqb; -uid &lt;uid&gt; &rsqb;


<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>
<bf>spy</bf> will connect to <em>venus</em> on the given host and report all Coda
files that are opened.  This is useful for generating <em>hoard</em> files
as programs can have hidden dependencies.  Using spy will ensure that
any file that is opened gets included in the <em>hoard</em> database.
Sending <bf>spy</bf> a <em>SIGTERM</em> will cause <bf>spy</bf> to flush all of its
output buffers and terminate.

<bf>spy</bf> supports the following options:

<descrip>
<tag><bf>-host</bf> <em>hostname</em></tag>Name of Coda coda client
to bind to.  If this option is omitted, then the current host will be
used.
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><bf>-uid</bf> <em>uid</em></tag>Only report on file activity
from user <em>uid</em>.  If the <bf>-uid</bf> switch is omitted, then all CFS
file activity is reported.
<P></descrip>

To use <bf>spy</bf> to create a <em>hoard</em> file sort the output and remove
any duplicates, By using <bf>spy</bf> you ensure that you did not forget to
<em>hoard</em> a file with a hidden 
dependency.  For example, when you <em>hoard X</em>, you will need the
<em>uncompress (1)</em> program in order to use the fonts.
