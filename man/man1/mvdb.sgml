<mansect>NAME 
 <P>mvdb - Atomically update files in a directory



<mansect>SYNOPSIS<P>
<bf>mvdb</bf>  &lsqb;-l lockfile&rsqb; file1 file2 ...

or

<bf>mvdb</bf> &lsqb;-l lockfile&rsqb; newfile1=file1  newfile2=file2 .....


<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>
<bf>mvdb</bf> is used to lock a directory exclusively and then atomically 
update a set of files in it.  A file is moved in only if it does not already 
exist in the current directory, or if the version in this directory is older.  
You must be <tt>cd</tt>'d into the destination directory already.  If you do 
not specify a <em>lockfile</em>, the current directory "." is locked.  The 
Unix primitive <em>flock</em>() is used for locking.  For each file moved in, 
you can choose to retain
the original name or give it a new name by using the <em>newfile=file</em> construct.  If a file 
<em>filename</em> already exists in the directory, it is first renamed to <em>filename.BAK</em>.
The dates of the target are copied from the source files.

The options are:

<descrip>
<tag><bf>-v</bf></tag>Verbose mode.  Will print out information on the progress of the command.
<P></descrip>
<descrip>
<tag><bf>-u</bf></tag>Force update.  Moves in the files even if the source files are not newer.
<P></descrip>


<mansect>EXAMPLE<P>
<tscreen><verb>
cd /itcbin/vice/bin
mvdb /usr/andrew/bin venus2.sun=venus2 file salvage 
</verb></tscreen>



<mansect>BUGS<P>
All the files have to come from the same source directory.

You have to be <tt>cd</tt>'d into the target directory.
You need Lock rights in Vice directories for locking.
