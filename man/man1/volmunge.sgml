<mansect>NAME 
<bf>volmunge</bf> - manipulate objects within Coda.

<mansect>SYNOPSIS
<bf>volmunge</bf> <-adfmov> dir
<p>

<descrip>

<tag/<bf>-a</bf>/
Print out everything but do not cross volume boundaries.
<tag/<bf>-d</bf>/
Prints out UNIX directories, but not volume mount points.
<tag/<bf>-f</bf>/
print out all objects which are not volume mount points (eg
UNIX Files and UNIX Directories); this preforms a stat()
call on all non-volume objects  which is  ideal for forcing resolution 
on a volume.
<tag/<bf>-m</bf>/
Print out those objects which are volume mount points.
<tag/<bf>-o</bf>/
Print out those objects which are UNIX files and preform an  open() call 
on the file.
<tag/<bf>-v</bf>/
Print out the volume name of a volume's mount point.
</descrip>

<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>
<p>
<bf>volmunge</bf> is ideal for identifying Coda Objects versus
regular UNIX files (including UNIX directories) store within the
Coda filesystem.  It will work recursively.
<p>
Because the <bf>-f</bf> and <bf>-o</bf> call the stat(), and open()
functions respectively, resolution many be forced with volmunge
if one is re-constituting a replicated Coda volume or group of volumes
mounted on top of each other.
