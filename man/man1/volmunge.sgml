<mansect>NAME 
<bf>volmunge</bf> - manipulates objects within Coda.

<mansect>SYNOPSIS
<bf>volmunge</bf> <-adfmov> dir
<p>

<descrip>

<tag/<bf>-a</bf>/
Prints out everything but does not cross volume boundaries.
<tag/<bf>-d</bf>/
Prints out UNIX directories, but not volume mount points.
<tag/<bf>-f</bf>/
Prints out all objects which are not volume mount points (eg
UNIX files and UNIX directories); this preforms a stat()
call on all non-volume objects which is ideal for forcing resolution 
on a volume.
<tag/<bf>-m</bf>/
Prints out those objects which are volume mount points.
<tag/<bf>-o</bf>/
Prints out those objects which are UNIX files and preforms an open() call 
on the file.
<tag/<bf>-v</bf>/
Prints out the volume name of a volume's mount point.
</descrip>

<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>
<p>
<bf>volmunge</bf>: is ideal for identifying Coda objects versus
regular UNIX files (including UNIX directories) stored within the
Coda filesystem.  It will work recursively.
<p>
Because the, <bf>-f</bf> and <bf>-o</bf>, call the stat(), and open()
functions respectively, resolution many be forced with volmunge
if one is reconstituting a replicated Coda volume or group of volumes
mounted on top of each other.
