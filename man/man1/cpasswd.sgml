<sect1>NAME 
 <P>cpasswd - change Coda login password



<sect1>SYNOPSIS<P>
<bf>cpasswd</bf> &lsqb;-h host&rsqb; &lsqb;username&rsqb;<P>


<sect1>DESCRIPTION<P>
This command sets the password associated with the current user, or user 
<em>username</em> if explicitly named.  Only the user or a System Administrator 
may change a password.  

<em>cpasswd</em> prompts for the users old password (or the password of the 
administrator performing the change) and then for the new one.  The new 
password must be typed twice, to forestall mistakes.  Change requests 
can be aborted by typing a carriage return when prompted for the new password.

New passwords must be at least four characters long if they use a sufficiently 
rich alphabet and at least six characters long if monocase.  These rules are 
relaxed if you are insistent enough.

<em>cpasswd</em> wont be able to change the users password if the password server is down.  
An appropriate error message will be printed, advising the caller to try again later.  
Once the password server acknowledges receipt the users new password, it takes about 
an hour for the information to propagate to the entire set of
<em>AuthServers</em>.

<bf>cpasswd</bf> support the following option:
<descrip>
<tag><bf>-h</bf> <em>host</em></tag>Tells <bf>cpasswd</bf> which
authentication host to bind to.  This should be the SCM.
<P></descrip>



<sect1>FILES<P>
<em>/vice/db/user.coda</em>



<sect1>BUGS<P>
The password file information should be kept in a different data structure 
allowing indexed access; <em>dbm (3X)</em> would probably be suitable.
