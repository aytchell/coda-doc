<mansect>NAME 
 <P>clog - Authenticate yourself to the Coda file system



<mansect>SYNOPSIS<P>
<bf>clog</bf> &lsqb;&lsqb;-x&rsqb; user &lsqb; password &rsqb; &rsqb;<P>


<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>
This command enables users to get tokens to use for authenticated
communication with a Coda File System.  The given name 
and password are passed to an <em>Authentication Server</em>.  The 
<em>Authentication Server</em> returns a set of tokens encoding the chosen 
identity if the password is correct.  <bf>clog</bf> passes these tokens to the
<em>venus</em> process, which acts as the users agent for file 
manipulation.  These tokens have a limited lifetime, becoming invalid after 25 hours. If an attempt is made to operate on a Coda File System object
while the user is not authenticated, the user will assume the privileges of the 
<em>Anonymous</em> user.

<em>clog</em> accepts the following arguments:
<descrip>
<tag><bf>user</bf></tag>Login name you wish to be identified as.
<P></descrip>
<descrip>
<tag><bf>passwd</bf></tag>Password corresponding to the 
given user name.  (If not provided on the command line, the user will be prompted for one.)
<P></descrip>


<mansect>BUGS<P>
The <bf>-x</bf> switch is not needed.  Specifying a <em>username</em> and
<em>passwd</em> is sufficient.
