<mansect>NAME 
 <P>clog - Authenticate yourself to the Coda file system



<mansect>SYNOPSIS<P>
<!-- <bf>clog</bf> &lsqb;&lsqb;-x&rsqb; user &lsqb; password &rsqb; &rsqb;<P> -->
<bf>clog</bf> &lsqb;-pipe&rsqb; &lsqb;-test&rsqb; &lsqb;-host &lt;authserver&gt;&rsqb; &lsqb;-kerberos4&verbar;-kerberos5&verbar;-coda&rsqb; &lsqb;-tofile &lt;file&gt;&rsqb; &lsqb;-fromfile &lt;file&gt;&rsqb; &lsqb;&lt;username&gt;&rsqb;<P>


<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>
This command enables users to get tokens to use for authenticated
communication with a Coda File System.  The given name and a password or
kerberos token are passed to an <em>Authentication Server</em>. The
<em>Authentication Server</em> returns a set of tokens encoding the
chosen identity if the password is correct.  <bf>clog</bf> passes these
tokens to the <em>venus</em> process, which acts as the users agent for
file manipulation. These tokens have a limited lifetime, becoming
invalid after 25 hours. If an attempt is made to operate on a Coda File
System object while the user is not authenticated, the user will assume
the privileges of the <em>Anonymous</em> user.

<em>clog</em> accepts the following arguments:
<descrip>
<tag><bf>-pipe</bf></tag>For use in shell scripts, the password is read
from stdin. This option is also enabled when stdin is not a tty.
<tag><bf>-test</bf></tag>Test the clog-venus token passing code.
<tag><bf>-host</bf> &lt;authserver&gt;</tag>Specify the host where the
authentication server is running.
<tag><bf>-kerberos4&verbar;-kerberos5&verbar;-coda</bf></tag>Authentication mechanism,
use kerberos tickets or coda password to identify yourself to the
authentication server.
<tag><bf>-tofile</bf> &lt;file&gt;</tag>After obtaining a token from the
authentication server, write it to a file.
<tag><bf>-fromfile</bf> &lt;file&gt;</tag>Read a previously saved token
from a file and present it to venus.
<tag><bf>&lt;username&gt;</bf></tag>Login name you wish to be identified as.
<P></descrip>

<mansect>BUGS<P>
The on-disk tokens are not encrypted. The -pipe option should be
dropped, the isatty(stdin) test is sufficient for most cases. The -test
option should also test the reading and writing code of token files.
