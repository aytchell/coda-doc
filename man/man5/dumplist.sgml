<sect1>NAME 
 <P>dumplist - List of volumes to be archived by the Coda backup mechanism



<sect1>Description<P>
The dumplist file contains information for the <bf>backup</bf>(8) program. It
contains two lists. The first is a list of partitions which will hold the
dumpfiles from the backup process. The second is a list of volumes to be
archived. 

The first is a list of directories in 
which to store dump files. This list is preceeded by a line consisting of the 
keyword <bf>Partitions</bf>. It allows the administrator to evenly spread the dump files
over many paritions on the backup coordinator, allowing the collective dumped state
to be larger than a single Unix partition (2 Gigabytes). 

The second list contains the volumes to be backed up. The first line (which also
terminates the first list) contains the keyword <bf>Volumes</bf>. Each entry in the list
contains three tab separated fields: the volumeId (groupId), the schedule for full
and incremental dumps, and a comment used to facilitate reading the output of the
<bf>backup</bf> program. The schedule contains a number of "F" and "I" characters. Each
character represents what form of dump to take for that day in the schedule. The length
of the period is the number of characters in the schedule. For instance, "FIIIIII"
means take one full dump followed by 6 incrementals, whereas "F" means take a full
dump every day. For convenience, the first character in a 7 day schedule refers
to Sunday.



<sect1>EXAMPLE<P>
The following does a full backup of <em>coda&lowbar;root</em>, <em>coda&lowbar;root.i386</em>, and
<em>coda&lowbar;root.tmp</em> on Monday while it does a full backup of
<em>coda&lowbar;root.project</em> and <em>coda&lowbar;root.usr</em> on Wednesday.  It uses
<em>/vicepa/backup</em> and <em>/usr/codabackup/backup</em> to store the dump files.
