<sect1>NAME 
 <P>multicastagents - multicastagents file specification




<sect1>DESCRIPTION<P>
This text file lists all the multicast agents known to the system.
It is read by each magent daemon to learn the IP addresses of its colleagues and the range of transient IP multicast addresses that it is allowed to allocate.
Each line describes one multicast agent, according to the following format:

&lt;agent address&gt;  &lt;min allocation address&gt;  &lt;max allocation address&gt;  &lt;comments&gt;

All addresses are in internet dot format (a.b.c.d).
Allocation addresses must be valid class D addresses, i.e., in the range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.



<sect1>FILES<P>
/etc/multicastagents



<sect1>BUGS<P>
This file is applicable only for multicast support as specified in RFC-988.
A new multicast support specification, RFC-1054, has been released which supercedes RFC-988.
