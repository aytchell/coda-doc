<mansect>NAME 
<P>
multicastgroups - multicastgroups file specification


<mansect>DESCRIPTION
<P>
This text file lists all the permanent IP multicast addresses and their
corresponding membership keys. It is read by each magent daemon.  Each line
describes one multicast group, according to the following format:
<tscreen><verb>	
  <multicast address> <key-high> <key-low> <group name>
</verb></tscreen>

All addresses are in internet dot format (a.b.c.d), and must be valid class D
addresses, i.e., in the range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.  Membership keys
are represented as a pair of 32-bit hex numbers.  Unrestricted groups should
have null keys (i.e., 00000000).

<mansect>BUGS<P>
This file is applicable only for multicast support as specified in RFC-988.
A new multicast support specification, RFC-1054, has been released which supercedes RFC-988.

Only unrestricted groups should be used.
The protection offered by restricted groups is bogus, and was never tested.
