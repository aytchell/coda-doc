<sect1>NAME 
 <P>servers - map server names to numbers




<sect1>DESCRIPTION<P>
Each file server has a file, <em>/vice/db/servers</em>, which maps server names to numbers.
The server numbers are 8 bit numbers so a maximum of 256 servers can be supported.
Once a server number has been assigned, it may <bf>not</bf> be reused.
You should not reassign a server a new id without initializing the server.

The server numbers are used in too many places, probably the most important is
in the creation of volumes.  The server creating a volume uses its server number
as the first byte of the four-byte volume identification number in order to ensure uniqueness.

NOTE: Replicated volume numbers must also be unique, so we reserve part of the range,
0-127 (0-7F hex), for this purpose.  Real server numbers must <bf>not</bf> be allocated from
the other subrange, and vice-versa.

The format of the file is the full server name (e.g. mahler.coda.cs.cmu.edu) followed
by a tab and then the servers number.  Any line beginning with a "#" is considered
a comment and is ignored.  The following is an example servers file:

<sect1>FILES<P>
/vice/db/servers


<sect1>BUGS<P>
The server numbers and replicated volume prefixes are pulled from the same number space.
Separation is enforced only by convention.

This file and /vice/db/hosts should be combined.
