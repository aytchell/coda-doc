<sect1>NAME 
 <P>vsgdb - Volume Storage Group Data Base specification




<sect1>DESCRIPTION<P>
The volume storage group data base is stored in ASCII form in <em>/vice/db/VSGDB</em> on the system control machine (SCM).
It maps VSG numbers into the sets of servers which comprise them.
Each VSG is represented by a single line with the following format:

&lt;VSG number&gt;  &lt;server-name 1&gt;  ...  &lt;server-name n&gt;

VSG numbers are in hexadecimal, and must correspond to a legal multicast address as specified in the multicastgroups (5) file.
Server names must correspond to entries in the servers (5) data base.
There is a limit of 8 on the number of servers in any one VSG.
A sample entry from the VSGDB is:

<bf>E0000107 mahler vivaldi ravel</bf>

The VSGDB is consulted by the <em>createvol&lowbar;rep (8)</em> script when creating a replicated volume.
The VSG number specified is looked up in the VSGDB to determine which sites will host the supporting read-write volumes.
The VSG number is then wired-into the VRList (and then <em>vrdb) (5)</em> entry for the new replicated volume.
