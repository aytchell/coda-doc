<mansect>NAME 
 <P>groups.coda - Coda group file specification

 

<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>
The Coda groups file specifies what groups exist and what users belong to
these groups.  The format of the file is:
<tscreen><verb>
  <Group Name> <Group Id> <Member1> <Member2> ...
</verb></tscreen>

This file is then compiled with <em>pwd2pdb</em> to create a vice.pdb file 
that vice uses for its password database.
