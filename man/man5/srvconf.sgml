<mansect>NAME 
<P><em>/vice/srv.conf</em>

<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>

<em>srv.conf</em> is used by <bf>startserver</bf> to provide the 
RVM Log, RVM Data and RVM Data Size information to <bf>srv</bf>.
The format of the file is a single line containing space separated
parameters needed by <bf>srv</bf>:

<tscreen><verb>
-rvm RVM_LOG_DEVICE RVM_DATA_DEVICE RVM_DATA_DEVICE_SIZE
</verb></tscreen>

For example:

<tscreen><verb>
-rvm /dev/hdc1 /usr/RVMDATA 20400000
</verb></tscreen>

provides the RVM LOG as device <em>/dev/hdc1</em> and RVM data 
as a file <em>/usr/RVMDATA</em> of roughly 20MB in size to <bf>srv</bf>.

<mansect>BUGS<P>
While not a bug with <em>srv.conf</em>, if multiple lines exist
containing multiple valid RVM&lowbar;LOG and RVM&lowbar;DATA 
information (which can be caused by running <bf>vice-setup-rvm</bf>
multiple times and not removing <em>/vice/srv.conf</em> each time),
all the lines are parsed by <bf>srv</bf> as a single set of arguments.  
his results in <bf>srv</bf> crashing and recording the message 
``Multiple instance error'' in <em>/vice/srv/SrvLog</em>.
