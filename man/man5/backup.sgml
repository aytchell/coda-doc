<mansect>NAME 
 <P>backup - Format of a Coda backup tape



<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>
Each backup tape contains a series of tar files, the first and last of
which are labels.  The start and end labels are identical and contain
version information, the date the backup was taken, and an index which
maps individual dump files into offests of the tape.  Thus to find a
dump file, read the label, then use <bf>mt</bf>(1) to fast forward to the
file specified by the labels index.
