<sect1>NAME 
 <P>readdump - Utility to examine dumpfiles created by the Coda backup facility



<sect1>SYNOPSIS<P>
<bf>readdump</bf> &lsqb;dumpfile&rsqb;<P>


<sect1>DESCRIPTION<P>
The <bf>readdump</bf> program is an interactive facility to allow the user to
get information from a dump file produced by the Coda backup mechanism. For
now it is simply a way of looking at the information in a dump file. One
cannot use it to modify the dump file.

The <bf>readdump</bf> program supports the following commands:
<descrip>
<tag><bf>openDumpFile</bf>  &lt;dumpfile&gt;</tag> 
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><bf>showHeader</bf></tag> 
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><bf>showVolumeDiskData</bf></tag> 
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><bf>setIndex</bf>  &lt;index type&gt;</tag> 
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><bf>nextVnode</bf></tag> 
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><bf>skipVnodes</bf> &lt;nVnodes&gt;</tag> 
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><bf>quit</bf></tag> 
<P></descrip>

<bf>readdump</bf> uses the <em>ci</em> command interface, which allows the
use of unique prefixes for commands. Unspecified parameters will be prompted
for, and default values can be used. The <em>showHeader</em> command prints
out the header of the dump, which is seperate from the header of the volume
that was dumped. The <em>showVolumeDiskData</em> prints out the header of the
volume.

The dump contains two streams of vnodes, one for directories and one for
files and symbolic links. The <em>setIndex</em> command specifies to
<bf>readdump</bf> which stream you wish to examine. Once an index has been
specified, the <em>nextVnode</em> command displays the next Vnode (object) in
the stream. Note that movement through the stream is one-directional. To
revisit a Vnode, use the <em>setIndex</em> command to reset the program back
to the beginning of the stream.  One can jump through the index by use of the
<em>skipVnodes</em> command, which takes the number of vnodes to skip, and
reads past (without displaying) that many vnodes in the stream.



<sect1>Future Work<P>
Usage of this facility should suggest more commands to help administrators
parse dumpfiles. In particular, a command to seek ahead to a specified offset
in the dump would be useful.
