<mansect>NAME 
 <P>createvol - create a non-replicated volume



<mansect>SYNOPSIS<P>
<bf>createvol</bf> &lt;volume-name&gt; &lt;server-name&gt; &lt;partition-name&gt;<P>


<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>
<bf>createvol</bf> is used to create a Coda non-replicated volume on the specified
partition (<em>&lt;partion-name&gt;)</em> and server (<em>&lt;server-name&gt;)</em>.  The 
volume number is assigned by the server automatically; the name is 
specified by the invoker (<em>&lt;volume-name&gt;)</em>.  

<bf>createvol</bf> first checks in <em>/vice/vol/AllVolumes</em> to see if the 
volume-name already exists.  If not, it uses the <em>volutil create</em>
command to create the volume at the specified server.  It then 
uses <em>bldvldb.sh (8)</em> to build the Volume Location Data Base (VLDB).

The default access control list of the volume gives the group System:Anyuser
read and lookup rights.  The owner of the root directory, as well as a more 
reasonable access list, must be set later by a system administrator
using the <em>cfs</em>(1) command.


<mansect>EXAMPLE<P>
To Create a volume for user "hbovik" on server "mahler":
<tscreen><verb>
createvol user.hbovik mahler /vicepa
</verb></tscreen>



<mansect>NOTES<P>
This command does not create the mount point to the volume within the 
file system hierarchy.  This must be created by the <bf>cfs mkmount</bf>(1) 
command.



<mansect>DIAGNOSTICS<P>
This command must be issued at the System Control Machine (SCM).  Also, 
it must be invoked with effective user id of root.  This command does not 
check for return codes from the servers once the volutil command is 
made.  The invoker must check by hand in the <em>/vice/vol/VolumeList</em> file 
on the server to see if the volume name exists at that server.
