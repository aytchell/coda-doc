 <P>fsck - file system consistency check and interactive repair



<sect1>SYNOPSIS<P>
<bf>/etc/fsck</bf> <bf>-p</bf> &lsqb; filesystem ... &rsqb; <P>
<bf>/etc/fsck</bf> &lsqb; <bf> -b block#</bf> &rsqb; &lsqb; <bf>-y</bf>&rsqb; &lsqb; <bf>-n</bf> &rsqb; &lsqb; filesystem &rsqb; ...<P>


<sect1>DESCRIPTION<P>

The first form of <em>fsck</em> preens a standard set of filesystems or the
specified file systems.  It is normally used in the script <bf>/etc/rc</bf>
during automatic reboot.  In this case <em>fsck</em> reads the table
<bf>/etc/fstab</bf> to determine which file systems to check.  It uses the
information there to inspect groups of disks in parallel taking maximum
advantage of I/O overlap to check the file systems as quickly as possible.
Normally, the root file system will be checked on pass 1, other ``root'' 
(``a'' partition) file systems on pass 2, other small file systems on separate
passes (e.g. the ``d'' file systems on pass 3 and the ``e'' file systems on 
pass 4), and finally the large user file systems on the last pass, e.g. pass 5.
Only partitions in fstab that are mounted ``rw'' or ``rq'' and that have 
nonzero pass numbers are checked.

The system takes care that only a restricted class of innocuous
inconsistencies can happen unless hardware or software failures intervene.
These are limited to the following:
<itemize>
<item> Unreferenced inodes

<item> Link counts in inodes too large

<item> Missing blocks in the free list

<item> Blocks in the free list also in files

<item> Counts in the super-block wrong
</itemize>


These are the only inconsistencies that <em>fsck</em> with the <bf>-p</bf>
option will correct; if it encounters other inconsistencies, it exits
with an abnormal return status and an automatic reboot will then fail.
For each corrected inconsistency one or more lines will be printed
identifying the file system on which the correction will take place,
and the nature of the correction.  After successfully correcting a file
system, <em>fsck</em> will print the number of files on that file system,
the number of used and free blocks, and the percentage of fragmentation.

If sent a QUIT signal, <em>fsck</em> will finish the file system checks, then
exit with an abnormal return status that causes the automatic reboot to fail.
This is useful when you wish to finish the file system checks, but do not
want the machine to come up multiuser.

Without the <bf>-p</bf> option, <em>fsck</em> audits and interactively
repairs inconsistent conditions for file systems.  If the file system is
inconsistent the operator is prompted for concurrence before each correction
is attempted.  It should be noted that some of the corrective actions which
are not correctable under the <bf>-p</bf> option will result in some loss of
data.  The amount and severity of data lost may be determined from the
diagnostic output.  The default action for each consistency correction is to
wait for the operator to respond <bf>yes</bf> or <bf>no</bf>.  If the
operator does not have write permission on the file system <em>fsck</em> will
default to a <bf>-n</bf> action.

<em>Fsck</em> has more consistency checks than its predecessors
<em>check</em>, <em>dcheck</em>, <em>fcheck</em>, and <em>icheck</em>
combined.

This version of <em>fsck</em> has been modified to support <bf>VICE</bf>
partitions.  <bf>VICE</bf> partitions may contain inodes which are not
referenced by any UNIX directory.  However, these inodes must be tagged with
a magic number to avoid being scavenged.

The following flags are interpreted by <em>fsck</em>:  
<descrip>
<tag><bf>-b</bf></tag>Use the block specified immediately after the flag as
the super block for the file system.  Block 32 is always an alternate super 
block.
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><bf>-y</bf></tag>Assume a ``yes'' response to all questions asked by 
<em>fsck</em>.  Use this flag with great caution, as it gives free license
to continue, even after encountering essentially unlimited trouble.  
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><bf>-n</bf></tag>Assume a ``no'' response to all questions asked by 
<em>fsck</em>; do not open the file system for writing.
<P></descrip>

If no filesystems are given to <em>fsck</em> then a default list of file
systems is read from the file <bf>/etc/fstab</bf> .

Inconsistencies checked are as follows:
<enum>
<item> Blocks claimed by more than one inode or the free list.

<item> Blocks claimed by an inode or the free list outside the range of the
  file system.

<item> Incorrect link counts.

<item> Size checks: Directory size not of proper format.

<item> Bad inode format.

<item> Blocks not accounted for anywhere.

<item> Directory checks:  
  <itemize>
  <item> File pointing to unallocated inode.
  <item> Inode number out of range.
  </itemize>

<item> Super block checks:  More blocks for inodes than there are in the 
  file system.

<item> Bad free block list format.

<item> Total free block and/or free inode count incorrect.
</enum>

Orphaned files and directories (allocated but unreferenced) are, with the
operators concurrence, reconnected by placing them in the <bf>lost+found</bf>
directory.  The name assigned is the inode number.  If the
<bf>lost+found</bf> directory does not exist, it is created.  If there is
insufficient space its size is increased.

Checking the raw device is almost always faster.
