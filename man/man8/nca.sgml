<mansect>NAME 
 <P>nca - Camelot Node server



<mansect>SYNOPSIS<P>
nca<P>


<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>
The Camelot Node Configuration Application (NCA) allows Camelot users
to manage data servers on Camelot nodes. Camelot applications can be
started, stopped, and configured using NCA. When NCA is run, the user
must first authenticate himself/herself by logging into NCA.

NCA provides an interactive interface to the Node Server. The Node Server
maintains a database which contains:


<itemize>
  <item> A list of users who may access the database;

  <item> A list of servers, server owners, and server restart parameters;

  <item> A list of currently running servers;

  <item> Server configuration information.
</itemize>

The most useful NCA commands are AddServer (as), StartServer (ss), ListServer
(ls), KillServer (ks), and Help (?). AddServer allows a user to add a data
server to the Node Servers database. StartServer starts the specified server.
ListServer returns information on all the servers, or just one if one is
specified. KillServer tells the Node Server to bring down a data server.
Finally, Help prints out the list of NCA commands.

There are three types of privileges that can be associated with an NCA account.
Admin allows the user access to all the NCA commands. User privileges do not
allow the user to add or delete users or modify the configuration of Camelot, but
do allow full access to data servers. If an account has no privileges, they
are only allowed to display information on the data servers.
