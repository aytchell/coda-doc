<mansect>NAME 
 <P>installclient - client installation script



<mansect>SYNOPSIS<P>
<bf>installclient</bf>	&lsqb;install | clean | update&rsqb;<P>


<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>
The <bf>installclient</bf> script automates much of the installation of Coda on
client workstations.  The <bf>install</bf> option creates necessary directories
and installs the Coda binaries in the proper places within them.  In 
addition, this option creates some devices necessary for Coda to run.
The <bf>clean</bf> option removes the Coda directories on the client
workstation.  The <bf>update</bf> option updates the Coda binaries from those
found in the installation directory.
