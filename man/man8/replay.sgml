<sect1>NAME 
 <P>replay - manual reintegration tool




<sect1>SYNOPSIS<P>
<bf>replay</bf>   &lsqb; key &rsqb;  filename<P>



<sect1>DESCRIPTION<P>

<bf>Replay</bf> is a tool for manually reintegrating operations done at a
disconnected client.  It provides a superset of the functionality of the
tape-archive program, tar(1).  The <bf>key</bf> argument is a string of
characters containing exactly one function letter and possibly one or more
function modifiers.  The <bf>filename</bf> argument specifies the tar/replay
format file containing the operations to be replayed.

The function portion of the key is specified by one of the following letters:
<descrip>
<tag><bf>r</bf></tag> <em>Replay</em> all operations specified in the file
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><bf>s</bf></tag> <em>Strip</em> out non-tar operations from the file and 
replay only the tar operations
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><bf>t</bf></tag> Do not replay but simply list the operations specified 
in the file
<P></descrip>


The following characters may be used in addition to the letter which selects the function desired:
<descrip>
<tag><bf>v</bf></tag> Be <em>verbose</em> about the operations
<P></descrip>

<descrip>
<tag><bf>h</bf></tag> Be <em>harsh</em> in replay, i.e., abort the program 
if any replayed operation fails
<P></descrip>


Replay can handle normal tar files since it invokes tar to perform
&lcub;create, link, symlink&rcub; operations.  However, its main purpose is
to replay checkpoint files saved by the Coda cache manager, Venus, during
disconnected operation.  These files may contain operations unknown to tar:
&lcub;setattr, unlink, rename, mkdir, rmdir&rcub;.  These other operations
are encoded in the tar file by overloading the linkflag and linkname fields.
Consult the replay.h header file for more details.



<sect1>BUGS<P>
There is a limit of 100 characters imposed on filename length by tar.

Filenames in checkpoint files generated by Venus are all relative to the
enclosing volume root.
