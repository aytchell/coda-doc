This document provides a short overview of configuration files for a
Coda installation

1. Client
---------

There are entries in /etc/services defining the ports on which Venus
listens

There is the mount directory /coda and a "helpful" file:
/coda/NOT_REALLY_CODA

There is a character device: /dev/cfs0 
crw-r--r--   1 root     root      67,   0 Mar 21 20:54 /dev/cfs0

There is the tree /usr/coda with a single configuration file:
|-coda-|-etc---------
       |-spool-------
       |-venus.cache-
/usr/coda/etc/vstab

Venus creates other files in this tree. The container files are held
in venus.cache.



2. Server
---------

RVM space: typically in /rvm which may well be a mount point of a
partition. A LOG and DATA file are present.  

/etc/services contains lines for vice services


Configuration files in / directory:
/ROOTVOLUME			contains name of the root volume
/.hostname			file contains hostname of server
/.scm		                file contains hostname of scm

The /vice vice subtree is the most important:
       |-backup-
       |-bin----
|-vice-|-db-----
       |-srv----
       |-vol----|-remote-

Configuration databases installed by scripts:
/vice/db/auth2.tk
/vice/db/volutil.tk		token files
/vice/db/files			files to be kept up to date by update

/vice/vol/maxgroupid		largest id of volume allocated so far
/vice/vol/fs.lock		empty lock file
/vice/vol/volutil.lock
/vice/vol/VolumeList            list of volume information
/vice/vol/.anonrc               file for anonymous ftp transport

/vice/db/servers		list of servers
/vice/db/hosts			a copy of /etc/hosts more or less
/vice/db/VSGDB                  volume storage group database

Run coda-user-setup to create initial copies of:
/vice/db/group.coda
/vice/db/user.coda    these two files are processed by initpdb to create
/vice/db/vice.pdb     processed by pcfgen to get:
/vice/db/vice.pcf     (binary)



/vice/vol/VRList
/vice/db/VRDB: volume relocation database (binary)
/vice/db/VLDB: volume location database (
