<sect>User Administration in Coda 5.2.x <p>

As of 5.2.x the user and group administration tools and databases have been
replaced. Now, instead of editing `user.coda' and `group.coda', and
then converting them with <em>pwdtopdb</em> and <em>pcfgen</em> has been replaced
by the new <em>pdbtool</em> program. This text gives a quick and dirty
introduction in working with the new tool, and ends with some notes on how to
upgrade pre-5.2.x servers.

<sect1>Short introduction to pdbtool <p>

The pdbtool is an interactive command to manipulate and query user and
group information. The most commonly used commands in the <em>pdbtool</em> are:

<verb>
    nui	&lt;username&gt; &lt;userid&gt;	     -- create a new user, with the specified id.
    ng &lt;groupname&gt; &lt;ownerid&gt;     -- create a new group, with the specified owner.
    ci &lt;user/groupname&gt; &lt;newid&gt;  -- change the id of an existing user or group.
    ag &lt;group-id&gt; &lt;user/groupid&gt; -- add a user/group to a group.
    n &lt;user/groupname&gt;           -- list all information about the user or group.
</verb>

<bf>Note:</bf> User-ids are supposed to be positive integers, group-ids are
negative integers.
<p>
For more information read the manualpage (pdbtool.8), which is included in the
coda-doc-5.2.0 rpms and tarball, read the coda-HOWTO, or simply play around
with the pdbtool's `help' command.

<sect1>Example: adding a new user<p>

This is a step-by-step example of the administrative steps involved in adding
a new user to Coda. Here we assume that the host named `scm' is one that has
the read-write copy of the databases. The new user is going to be added to the
groups Users and Developers.

<verb>
root@scm# pdbtool
pdbtool&gt; nui jan 768
pdbtool&gt; n jan
USER jan
  *  id: 768
  *  belongs to no groups
  *  cps: [ 768 ]
  *  owns no groups
pdbtool&gt; n Users
GROUP Users OWNED BY System
  *  id: -221
  *  owner id: 777
  *  belongs to no groups
  *  cps: [ -221 ]
  *  has members: [ 22 178 184 303 545 697 822 823 835 894 712 738
  *  777 901 902 ]
pdbtool&gt; n Developers
GROUP Developers OWNED BY System
  *  id: -225
  *  owner id: 777
  *  belongs to no groups
  *  cps: [ -225 ]
  *  has members: [ 122 835 ]
pdbtool&gt; ag -221 768
pdbtool&gt; ag -225 768
pdbtool&gt; n jan
USER jan
  *  id: 768
  *  belongs to groups: [ -221 -225 ]
  *  cps: [ -221 -225 768 ]
  *  owns no groups
pdbtool&gt; q
</verb>

This sequence has created the new user account, and added the account to the
appropriate groups. Now in order to activate the account, we need to set an
initial password with the authentication server.

<verb>
admin@anymachine$ au -h scm nu
Your Vice Name: codaadmin
Your Vice Password: ********
New User Name: jan
New User Password: newpassword
</verb>

To finish up, we can create a home volume, mount it, set the ACLs, and the
user is set up. So all the user needs to do is change his password.

<verb>
root@scm# createvol_rep users:jan E0000100 /vicepa
admin@anymachine$ cfs mkm /coda/usr/jan users:jan
admin@anymachine$ cfs sa /coda/usr/jan jan all

jan@anymachine$ cpasswd -h scm
</verb>

<sect1>Upgrading existing user.coda and group.coda databases<p>

To upgrade the user and group databases to the new 5.2.x format, a script
called <em>pwdtopdbtool.py</em> has been added to the distribution. You might
need to alter the pathnames of <em>/vice/db/user.coda</em> and
<em>/vice/db/group.coda</em>. Simply run this script on the SCM and it will
parse out all entries from the old user and group files, and uses the pdbtool
to create the new <em>prot_users.db</em> and <em>prot_index.db</em> files in
/vice/db.
<p>
To distribute these files to the other servers, you should add the following
to <em>/vice/db/files</em>.

<verb>
prot_users.db
prot_index.db
</verb>

As long as there are pre-5.2 servers in the group, it is advised to stick to
the old way of adding users, and use the <em>pwdtopdbtool.py</em> script to keep
the new files in sync.

<sect1>Upgrading from the coda.pdb/name.pdb databases used in 5.2.0/5.2.2<p>

The initial release using the pdbtools used gdbm as the underlying data store.
However we were unable to reliably use the resulting databases across
heterogeneous servers. So we decided to switch to libdb 1.85.
<p>

There is no script available to automatically upgrade your gdbm databases to
libdb 1.85 format. If you still have existing users.coda/groups.coda, simply
run <em>pwdtopdbtool.py</em>.
<p>
Otherwise, you must extract all information using the old pdbtool BEFORE
upgrading your SCM.
<p>

<verb>
# echo list | pdbtool > full_pdb_dump
</verb>

However, it is not possible to easily use this dump to recreate the database.
Everything needs to be re-added to the new pdb database by hand.
