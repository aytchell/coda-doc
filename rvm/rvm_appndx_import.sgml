contains instructions to import and install RVM.  The process is
set up to be a compatible as possible with both Mach 2.6 and Unix BSD
4.3.  Support for other versions of Unix is limited, but in general,
RVM attempts to keep its system requirements to a minimum to enhance
portability.  Where necessary for specific versions of Unix and
related systems, special instructions are included below.

@SubSection&lsqb;Current Release (RVM 1.3, 29 June 1994)&rsqb;

This release corrects some error reporting bugs in <tt>rvmutl</tt> and the
segment loader.  No reinitialization of log files is necessary.  All
that is required to use this version is to recompile and relink your
applications after importing and installing RVM.

@SubSection&lsqb;Release (RVM 1.3, 25 April 1994&rsqb;

This release corrects a few small bugs and synchronizes the export and
Coda versions.  Re-initialization of your log files is recommended.

To reinitialize log files, for each existing log file (or partition),
use your present version of <tt>rvmutl</tt> to force any remaining records to
be reflected in the modified segments, and then reinitialize the log
with the new version of <tt>rvmutl</tt>:

<code>
@TabClear()
@TabSet(+2.5 inches)
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/bin/rvmutl</tt>@\# RVM 1.2
<tt>* open&lowbar;log &lt;log file name&gt;</tt>
<tt>* recover</tt>
<tt>* quit</tt>
</code>

<code>
@TabClear()
@TabSet(+2.5 inches)
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/bin/rvmutl</tt>@\# RVM 1.3
<tt>* init&lowbar;log &lt;log file name&gt; &lt;size&gt;</tt>
<tt>* quit</tt>
</code>

@SubSection&lsqb;Release RVM 1.3, 4 April 1994&rsqb;

This release contains a more complete verion of the manual and
corrects a bug in <tt>rvm&lowbar;basher</tt>
that caused reports of virtual memory not matching the disk.  The
problem was in the test program itself, not the RVM library, so those
who have been using RVM for development can be confident of their
persistent data.

Other changes are addition of error checking in the segment loader
and RDS initialization functions.  Also, the utility <tt>rdsinit</tt> has
been made somewhat more forgiving.  You can now enter lengths in
decimal as well as octal and hexadecimal.  The values input are
checked for minimal agreement with the requirements of RDS and a size
check on the file being created is made to insure that the regions
declared will fit in the file.

No recompilation or log re-initialization is necessary if you are
upgrading from the 14 March 1994 release.  Those who are using the
pre-public release, RVM 1.2, should follow the instructions below.

@SubSection&lsqb;Earlier Release (RVM 1.3, 14 March 1994)&rsqb;

This release was the first public release, but for those presently using
the informal release, RVM 1.2, recompilation of modules using RVM and
re-initialization of the log is necessary.  To reinitialize the log,
use the procedure specified above.
<sect1>Importing RVM<p>
@Case(Device,
    File
    	&lcub;<!--1 Line-->&rcub;,
    PagedFile
    	&lcub;<!--1 Line-->&rcub;

To import RVM, use FTP to get the file RVM.TAR into the directory from
which you wish to build RVM.  Use the CMU Computer Science FTP server:

<code>
@TabClear()
@TabSet(+2.5 inches)
<tt>cd &lt;your directory&gt;</tt>
<tt>ftp FTP.CS.CMU.EDU</tt>
<tt>Name: anonymous</tt>
<tt>password: &lt;userid&gt;@@host</tt>
<tt>cd project/rvm-releases</tt>
<tt>get README</tt>@\# this text
<tt>get rvm&lowbar;manual.ps</tt>@\# RVM manual (PostScript)
<tt>binary</tt>@\# required for tar files
<tt>get RVM@Value(Release).TAR</tt>@\# packed source files
<tt>quit</tt>
</code>

You should also send mail to rvm@@cs.cmu.edu to be placed on a mailing
list for future updates.

@Begin(Transparent, Break,Group)
Then unpack the files:

<code>
<tt>tar xf RVM@Value(Release).TAR</tt>
</code>
@End(Transparent)

At this point, you can delete the RVM@Value(Release.TAR) file to
recover disc space.

If you are building for any of the following machine and/or types, you
must make the following modifications before continuing the installation.
If your machine/OS is not mentioned, no special action is needed.

<sect2>OSF/1<p> 

Delete the following files:

<code>
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/Makeconf</tt>
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/rvm/Makeconf</tt>
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/rds/Makeconf</tt>

<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/tests/Makeconf</tt>
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/bench-SOSP93/Makeconf</tt>
</code>

<sect2>HP 9000 "snakes"<p>

make doesnt support the include directive, so you will have to modify
the Makefiles.  In the following files, replace the include
command
after the "get basic definitions" with the definitions and macros in
the build&lowbar;defs file which will be found in the RVM directory created
by unpacking the tar file:

<code>
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/rvm/Makefile</tt>
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/rds/Makefile</tt>
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/seg/Makefile</tt>
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/tests/Makefile</tt>
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/bench-SOSP93/Makefile</tt>
</code>

@Case(Device,
    File
    	&lcub;<!--1 Line-->&rcub;,

    	&lcub;<!--1 Line-->&rcub;
)

Execute the following commands:

<code>
<tt>cd RVM@Value(Release)</tt>
<tt>make initialize</tt>
</code>

The above sequences will create the necessary directory structure
rooted as <tt>RVM@Value(Release)</tt> in the directory where the tar file
was unpacked, and compile the system.  When complete, you will have
the following directories under RVM@Value(Release):

@Begin(Description, LeftMargin +2.5 inches, Indent -1.5 inches,
RightMargin +.5 inches, Group)
lib@\repository for the RVM, RDS and SEG libraries.

bin@\repository for RVM-related programs, rvmutl,
rdsinit, and the test programs.

include@\repository for header files for RVM subsystems.

rvm@\source code for RVM.

rds@\source code for RDS, a dynamic allocator.

seg@\source code for SEG, a loader for RVM segments.

tests@\source code and test files for RVM.

bench-SOSP93@\source code for the benchmark used in the
SOSP-93 paper@~
@Case(Device,
    File
	"",
    PagedFile
	"",
    else
    	" @Cite(RVM)"
).

OBJS@\(Mach only) directory structure for machine-specific
build areas, normally cleared after the initial build process.
@End(Description)

These directories and files are fully built (for Mach) in the
RVM@Value(Release) 
directory on the FTP server, so you can see what you should get if
there is trouble.

The lib, bin, and include directories are the interface for
application build procedures.  References to them will get the correct
headers, libraries, and utility programs.  They are particularly
important under Mach since lib and bin are symbolic links to
machine 
dependent files.  Under Unix, they are directories with the actual
files; no support is provided for compilation for multiple machine
types.  Also, the build procedure under Unix leaves all derived files
in the same directories as the sources since the OBJS directory
structure is not built.  The structure used by the Mach build process
could also be used for Unix by modifying the Makefiles to use the
machine specifier used on your system to replace the @@sys
construct used in Mach.

<sect2>The Makefiles<p>

The Makefiles included are intended to both install the system and
help with the building of customized versions.  The process can be
controlled from two levels: the top level, at the RVM@Value(Release)
directory, for 
builds of all the subsystems.  The second level is builds of a
specific subsystem from its source directory.  From the top level, the
following build options are available:

@Begin(Description, LeftMargin +2.5 inches, Indent -1.5 inches,
RightMargin +.5 inches)
make initialize@\creates directory structures for derived files
and then compiles all libraries, utility and test programs.  This
should be done only once.

make install@\does a complete recompilation and installation.
If the necessary directories are not present,
they will be built.  All existing derived files 
are removed before the build so that a complete
rebuild is guaranteed.

make release@\builds all subsystems from existing derived
files, and copies the interface files to the
appropriate directories.  Intended for a
release after work has been done on one or
more subsystems.

make all@\builds all subsystems from existing derived
files, but does not copy files to the
interface directories.

make clean@\removes all derived files from the subsystem
directories and OBJS, if it is built.  The <tt>lib</tt> and <tt>bin</tt>
directories are not affected.  This is recommended to recover disk
space after the initial
build of RVM if you do not plan on making modifications to RVM.

make &lcub;rvm, rds, seg, tests, bench-SOSP93&rcub;@\
builds the specified subsystem.
@End(Description)

From the subsystem level, the install, reinstall, all, and clean
options are also available, and do their respected operation for only
that subsystem.  Further options are also available to create
specific libraries, utilities, and test programs.  These can be
determined by examining the subsystem Makefiles.

The version of Make used in Mach 2.6 will automatically include a file
called Makeconf if it exists.  This is used for common configuration
macros.  Since Unix Make doesnt support this, but does have an include
facility, most configuration macros are actually put in the file 
RVM@Value(Release/build&lowbar;defs), which is included are necessary.  The Makeconf
files contain Mach specific things only.
To allow the same Makefiles to be
used for both operating systems, most directories are referred to by
macro names which will evaluate appropriately for the system.  This is
done using only the most basic Make features in the hope that the
build will be as portable as possible.  One artifact of this method is
that the installation will produce a number of error messages followed
by messages of the form <tt>"*** Exit 1 (ignored)"</tt> as the inappropriate
commands fail.  Just note that this is expected behavior.

There are a number of other build options that are only used for the
Coda File System.  These should be ignored since they require many
files not included in the RVM distribution.

<sect2>Threads<p>

Under Mach, RVM is internally multi-threaded and expects to be linked
with the Cthreads package.  Either the Mach threads or coroutine
libraries can be used.  Coroutines are recommended while debugging
since program behavior can be repeatable.

Under Unix, RVM is at this time single threaded.  To allow RVM to
compile, symbolic links are created for the header file cthreads.h to
the file dummy&lowbar;cthreads.h.  No thread library will be required at link
time.  If you have a thread package that you would like to try to use,
the file rvm&lowbar;lwp.h can be used as a model of how to create a header
file for another thread package.  This not recommended for the faint
of heart!

<sect1>Testing RVM<p>
@Case(Device,
    File
    	&lcub;<!--1 Line-->&rcub;,
    PagedFile
    	&lcub;<!--1 Line-->&rcub;
)

This distribution of RVM includes two test programs: testrvm, a basic
"sanity checker", and rvm&lowbar;basher, a stress test.  You should run these
after installing RVM.  Running the simple test involves two steps:
creating a log file with rvmutl, and then running the test.  Its most
easily done from the RVM@Value(Release/tests) directory, but if you copy the
map&lowbar;*&lowbar;files and the t*&lowbar;chk&lowbar;files to any other place, you can
run it there.  The procedure is:

<code>
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/bin/rvmutl</tt>
<tt>* init&lowbar;log log&lowbar;file 10k</tt>
<tt>* quit</tt>

<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/bin/testrvm</tt>
</code>

It will then ask three questions, all of which you should simply enter
the default "No" by hitting return.  It will do some basic
transactions and compare virtual memory with the map&lowbar;chk&lowbar;file for
correct operation.  It will report correct operation.  Any other
termination is an indication of trouble.

rvm&lowbar;basher is a much more thorough test and should be run for several
hours.  The program requires that a data segment be built as well as a
log file.  The tests will randomly allocate, modify, and deallocate
recoverable memory, periodically stopping to check virtual memory
against the data segment.  Any discrepancy will be reported and the
program will stop.  Otherwise it will run until you stop it, given the
parameters supplied in this distribution.

rvm&lowbar;basher can also be used a a sample RVM application since it uses
most of the RVM library and also the dynamic allocator, RDS, and
segment loader.  The setup procedure for running it is similar to what
most applications will require, although their heap and static sizes
wiil most likely differ.

First, cd to a directory in which you can build about 2M of files.
Create a log file using rvmutl as in the the previous test:

<code>
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/bin/rvmutl</tt>
<tt>* init&lowbar;log basher&lowbar;log 600k</tt>
<tt>* sizeof page</tt>
<tt>* quit</tt>
</code>

To prepare a data segment, first load
...RVM@Value(Release/bin/rvm&lowbar;basher) and run the following commands:

<code>
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/bin/rvm&lowbar;basher</tt>
<tt>* log basher&lowbar;log</tt>
<tt>* show&lowbar;break</tt>
<tt>* run</tt>
</code>

The program will load and print the current break point (with
sufficient space added to compensate for internal requirements).
This will become the load point for the data segment.  Application
programs will also have to determine their break point after
initialization.  If you plan to use pointers in recoverable storage,
be sure to add enough to the breakpoint to allow growth of your
application.  Otherwise you will have to modify the pointers or
re-initialize recoverable storage to allow the break point to be moved.

Next, create a data segment with an RDS heap using the rdsinit
utility.
The static length must be the size of a page on your machine as
indicated by rvmutl when you created the log.  (Note: all mappings
must be integral page sized in RVM; your application can use as many
pages as need in both the heap and static regions -- the basher needs
only the minimum.)

<code>
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/bin/rdsinit basher&lowbar;log basher&lowbar;data</tt>
<tt>Enter the length of the file/device basher&lowbar;data: 1000000</tt>
<tt>   &lt;rdsinit will zero the file and initialize RVM&gt;</tt>
<tt>starting address of rvm: &lt;break point from above&gt;</tt>
<tt>heap len: 0xf0000</tt>
<tt>static len: &lt;static len&gt;</tt>
<tt>nlists: 100</tt>
<tt>chunksize: 128</tt>
</code>

You are now prepared to run the basher:

<code>
<tt>.../RVM@Value(Release)/bin/rvm&lowbar;basher &lt; .../RVM@Value(Release)/tests/basher&lowbar;parms</tt>
</code>

The file .../RVM@Value(Release/tests/basher&lowbar;parms) contains all the parameters to run a
thorough test of RVM and its subsystems.  As indicated earlier,
allowing it to run for at least several hours is recommended.

is included in
this distribution.  It is not known to work on Unix or on versions of 
Mach outside the Computer Science Dept. at CMU.  Unlike RVM, it is 
dependent on C++, and may have dependencies on the exact compiler
version.  The version of C++ used at CMU is AT&T C++ Version
2.  It is 
included as documentation for the methods used to produce the data for
the paper and most likely will not work as distributed on your machine.

One known problem is that the CMU CS C++ systems use &lt;libc.h&gt; instead of
&lt;stdlib.h&gt; which does not work correctly here.  
Before attempting to compile the benchmark, you will have to change this,
assuming your &lt;stdlib.c&gt; works.  The inclusion of &lt;mach.h&gt;, which is
required for compilation, will also cause trouble on Unix systems.
Also, attempts to use other C++ systems have produced multiple
definition errors for some of the standard functions such perror.

Because of these problems, no attempt is made to compile the
benchmark.  However, a Makefile that works at CMU is included as a
starting point if you wish to try building it.
