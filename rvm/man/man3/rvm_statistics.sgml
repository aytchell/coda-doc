 <P>rvm_statistics - query collected statistics

<mansect>SYNOPSIS

<verb>
#include "rvm_statistics.h"

typedef struct
    {
    /* see rvm_statistics.h for current fields */
    }
rvm_statistics_t;

rvm_return_t     rvm_statistics (version, statistics);
char             *version;    /* Statistics version string */

</verb>

<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>
<tt>rvm_statistics</tt> copies the statistics collected by RVM to a record
provided by the application.  The contents of the record can then be
analyzed by the application, or formated by <tt>rvm_print_statistics</tt>.

Note that the header <tt>rvm_statistics.h</tt> must be included to use the
statistics facility.  These declarations are not included in the
standard RVM library header since they are expected to change as RVM
is further developed.  Because of the expectation of change,
a version parameter is used to detect version skews between the
statistics record format of the application and the RVM library.
The string constant RVM_STATISTICS_VERSION from
rvm_statistics.h is passed to rvm_statistics, and compared with 
the value the library was compiled with.
If they are different, RVM_ESTAT_VERSION_SKEW is returned and no
data is copied to the statistics record.

The macro <tt>RVM_STATISTICS</tt> will automatically pass the version
string to the function.

The <tt>statistics</tt> parameter specifies the record to which the
statistics will be copied.
This record must be of type <tt>rvm_statistics_t</tt> and must
have been created by <tt>rvm_malloc_statistics</tt> or initialized with
<tt>rvm_init_statistics</tt>.
If the record is not properly formated by either of the above
functions, the error <tt>RVM_ESTATISTICS</tt> is returned.

For detailed specification of the statistics currently collected,
consult the header file <tt>rvm_statistics.h</tt> which is also
included in the RVM manual.
