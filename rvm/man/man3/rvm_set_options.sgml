#include "rvm.h"

    &lcub;
    char            *log_dev;

</verb>

<sect1>DESCRIPTION<P>
rvm_set_options allows RVM options to be changed after
initialization.
Only the options permitted to be selected after initialization will be considered.
Others can be present, but will be ignored.
Please refer to the RVM manual for detailed descriptions of the options.

If the options parameter does not point to a valid descriptor,
RVM_EOPTIONS will be returned.

At present, the only options that can be changed are the following:
truncation threshold and transaction optimization levels.
If the truncation threshold is lowered and the log filled beyond the
new threshold, a truncation is initiated if one is not in progress.
If a truncation must be initiated, it will run synchronously with the
calling thread.

<!--
If the recovery or flush buffer sizes are increased, it is possible
that the new buffers cannot be allocated.
In this case, RVM_ENO_MEMORY is returned, and the original buffer
is retained.
If the recovery buffer size is changed and a epoch truncation is in
progress, the new buffer size will not become 
effective until after the truncation completes.
Similarly, reallocating the flush buffer must wait for an ongoing
flush to complete.
-->

Transaction optimization levels can be changed at any time, but the
level in effect at the beginning of a transaction remains in effect
for that transaction until it is ended.
