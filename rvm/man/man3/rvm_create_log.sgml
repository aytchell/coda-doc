<mansect>NAME 
 <P>rvm_create_log - RVM log file creation

<mansect>SYNOPSIS
<p>
<verb>
#include "rvm.h"

rvm_return_t rvm_create_log (options, length, mode)

rvm_options   *options;  /* pointer to a RVM options record */
rvm_offset_t  *length;   /* length of log record area in file to be created */
long          mode;      /* protection mode of file to be created */
</verb>

<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>
rvm_create_log provides a mechanism for creating a log file from
within an application.
It is intended to allow an application to be self-installing by
silently creating the log and other RVM structures it needs.
To provide some protection against an applications automatically
over-writing a log containing valid records, rvm_create_log can
be used to create logs in Unix files only, and only if the file does
not already exist.
Creating logs in raw partitions must be done with the utility
<tt/rvmutl/.

The name of the log file to be created must be specified in the options record.
An options record created with typedef rvm_options_t must be used.
RVM_EOPTIONS will be returned if options does not point to a valid
record.
If either the name is not provided, or the file cannot be created and
initialized, RVM_ELOG will be returned.
Also, the total length of the file to be created must be permitted by the
file system.
This includes the length specified for log records plus the overhead
necessary for the log status area, presently one sector.
Options other than the log file name are ignored.

The mode parameter is the Unix file system protection mode and
must allow writing by the owner.  An i/o error will be returned if
the file cannot be created or written.

rvm_create_log does not declare the created log file as the
operational log.  This must be done by specifying an options
descriptor to <tt>rvm_set_options</tt>, <tt>rvm_initialize</tt>, or <tt>rvm_map</tt>.
