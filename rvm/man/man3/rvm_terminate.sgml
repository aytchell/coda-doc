rvm_terminate - terminate RVM

<sect1>SYNOPSIS
<P>
<verb>
#include "rvm.h"

rvm_return_t rvm_terminate ()
</verb>

<sect1>DESCRIPTION<P>
rvm_terminate checks for uncommitted transactions and otherwise insures
a clean exit from RVM.
If an uncommitted transaction is found, RVM_EUNCOMMIT is returned,
and the application should call rvm_query to
discover such transactions.
If any are discovered, this is an indicator of likely program logic errors.
If there are no uncommitted transactions, the log is flushed, and all
regions unmapped.

RVM cannot be reinitialized after termination.
