<mansect>NAME 
 <P>rvm_truncate - truncate the log


<mansect>SYNOPSIS
<p>
<verb>
#include "rvm.h"

rvm_return_t rvm_truncate ()
</verb>

<mansect>DESCRIPTION<P>
rvm_truncate makes visible the log truncation operation.
When the log is truncated, records for committed changes are used to update the
committed images of modified segments.
After modified data files are successfully updated, the records can
be deleted and the log "truncated."

Like log flushing, this operation is usually performed implicitly by RVM,
but is available to the application if it wishes to
schedule the operation itself.
rvm_truncate performs a flush before truncating, and is
synchronous with the calling thread.

rvm_truncate requires virtual memory working space.
If this space cannot be allocated, RVM_ENO_MEMORY is returned, and
the truncation is aborted.
If possible, the application can deallocate as much memory as possible
and retry the truncation.
This can done as many times as necessary.
If no memory can be freed, this error should be considered fatal.
