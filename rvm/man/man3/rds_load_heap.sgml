rds_load_heap, rds_start_heap - map recoverable storage

<sect1>SYNOPSIS
<p>
<verb>
#include "rds.h"

int rds_load_heap (DevName, DevLength, staticAddr, err);
char         *DevName;  /* name of heap segment */
rvm_length_t DevLength; /* length of heap raw partition */
char         **staticAddr; /* address of static region (out)*/
int          *err;      /* pointer to error return location */
   

int rds_start_heap (staticAddr, err);
char         **staticAddr; /* address of static region (out)*/
int          *err;      /* pointer to error return location */

<sect1>DESCRIPTION<P>
<tt>rds_load_heap</tt> provides a convenient method of mapping the heap
segment and initializing RDS.  The name of the file or partition
containing the recoverable heap is specified by <tt>DevName</tt>, and the
length of the partition is specified in <tt>DevLength</tt>.  If the heap 
is in a file, <tt>DevLength</tt> should be zero.

<tt>rds_load_heap</tt> calls <tt>rvm_load_segment</tt> to map the heap.  This
requires that the heap file or partition be created with
<tt>rds_zap_heap</tt> or <tt>rvm_create_segment</tt>, which is most conveniently
done with the <tt>rdsinit</tt> utility.
After the heap is mapped, the address of the static region is returned
in <tt>staticAddr</tt>.  <tt>rds_start_heap</tt> is automatically called to
initialize RDS.

If the actual mapping of the heap and static regions is done by the
application, <tt>rds_start_heap</tt> should be used to initialize RDS.  In this
case, the address of the static region must be specified to RDS in the
<tt>staticAddr</tt> parameter.

With either function, the version of RDS that the heap was built with
is compared with the version of the currently linked RDS library.  
If there is a mismatch, the error code <tt>EHEAP_VERSION_SKEW</tt> is returned.

Since these functions are called only to initialize the application,
RDS assumes there is no concurrent access and does no internal locking.
