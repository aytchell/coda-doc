<sect1>description<P>
rvm&lowbar;end&lowbar;transaction commits the changes made since the transaction
began.
All transactions can be committed with this function, regardless of
the mode they were begun with.
The transaction identifier must refer to a previously initiated transaction
or RVM&lowbar;ETID is returned.

Two commit modes are recognized: flush and no&lowbar;flush.
In a flush commit, the new value records for the transaction are
written (flushed) to the log file.
Permanence is then guaranteed upon successful return.

A no&lowbar;flush commit is faster than a commit with log flushing,
but provides a weaker guarantee of permanence.
The new value records are created, but not written to the log file.
Permanence is guaranteed only when they are flushed to the log
file.
This can be done either by a flush-mode commit of another transaction,
or by explicitly flushing the log with rvm&lowbar;flush.
An application can enhance performance by delaying the log flush (and permanence of changes) until a sequence of related transactions has
been completed.
Note that aborting the last transaction of such a sequence <em>will not</em>
restore the original state of transactions previously committed with
the no&lowbar;flush option.
RVM does not support nested transactions.
