rvm_flush - flush log records to log file


<sect1>SYNOPSIS
<p>
<verb>
#include "rvm.h"

rvm_return_t rvm_flush ()
</verb>

<sect1>DESCRIPTION<P>
rvm_flush makes visible the log flush operation, which
moves transaction records
to the log file and insures the permanence of the changes
represented by those records.
It is normally done with a transaction commit,
but is available
to the application if it wishes to schedule the flush after a sequence of
no_flush transactions.

rvm_flush is synchronous with the calling thread.
