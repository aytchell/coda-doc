<chapt>RVM Segment Loader<label id="RVMseg">
<p>
<em>Designed and programmed by David C. Steere</em>

The RVM segment loader provides a mechanism that allows a load map to
be created for a segment.  Regions can then be mapped
to specific virtual memory addresses or to virtual memory allocated by RVM
in a single library call.  There are only two library
functions: <tt>rvm_create_segment</tt> and <tt>rvm_load_segment</tt>.

To use the segment loader, a segment header must be created
by <tt>rvm_create_segment</tt>.  The header, which occupies the first page of the
segment, the load map for regions defined within
the segment, and a version identifier so that <tt>rvm_load_segment</tt> can
recognize suitable segments.  
All region lengths must be integral multiple of the
page size of the machine, which is available as the macro
<tt>RVM_PAGE_SIZE</tt>.  Virtual memory addresses must be page-aligned.

The load map is prepared in a vector of descriptors for the desired
regions (type <tt>rvm_region_def_t</tt>).  The descriptors specify just
two parameters:  the region length
and the virtual memory address where the region is to be loaded.
The offsets of the regions in the segment are assigned by
<tt>rvm_create_segment</tt>. 
If pointers are included in the data, a fixed virtual memory address must be
specified so that the loader will place the region there at each
loading.  If there are no pointers, the segment loader can be
instructed to allocate space for the region
by specifying an address of zero.
The segment loader will make virtual memory addressable as necessary when
loading.

The virtual memory address for the first region should be specified far
enough beyond the applications break 
point so that the program can grow during development.  Otherwise, there
will have to be a way to modify the pointers or rebuild the structures.

The segment header establishes the load map for only that segment.
If multiple segments are used, each must have its own header, and 
<tt>rvm_load_segment</tt> must be called for each.

The segment loader is used by the RDS allocator (see Chapter <ref
id="RDS" name="of RDS">) to automate loading of a persistent heap
region and a statically allocated region.  A utility program is
available to create the segment header and initialize the heap so that
it is easily loaded.

The header file giving all necessary definitions for the RVM segment
loader is included in Appendix <ref id="RVMheaders" name="of C
Declarations">.
