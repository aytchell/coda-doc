Welcome to the Coda SGMML documentation tree. 
=============================================

1. Building documentation

Get Linux. Get sgml-tools-1.0.7 - your luck may vary with other
versions.

1.1 Apply the patch in this directory to this release.  This patch does
the following:
 - adds to the dtd the possibility to include a man page in a chapter
 - adds to the dtd subsections for manpages
 - deals with formatting for these in man and latex2e
 - fixes a nasty bug in fmt_txt.pl which caused man pages to be misformatted.

1.2 Type configure

1.3 Type make {psdocs,manpages,htmldocs}
