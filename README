Welcome to the Coda SGMML documentation tree. 
=============================================

1. To use this tree:
   a) make sure your CVSROOT points to /afs/cs/project/coda-src/cvs
      (setenv CVSROOT /afs/cs/project/coda-src/cvs or 
       export CVSROOT=/afs/cs/project/coda-src/cvs)
   b) cvs checkout doc will produce your workspace in a subdirectory
      doc which cvs creates (watch it!!!)
   c) do your work: make sure the formatting works before checking
      in. 
   d) commit the work with cvs commit . in the doc directory.

2. For formatting, use a Linux box such as lesbos which has the
linuxdoc-sgml package installed.  In principle:
   a) making HTML: sgml2html filename
   b) making a dvi file: sgml2latex -d manual.sgml
   c) making a man page: sgml2txt -man cfs.sgml
