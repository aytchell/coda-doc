Welcome to the Coda SGMML documentation tree. 
=============================================

1. To use this tree:
   a) make sure your CVSROOT points to /afs/cs/project/coda-src/cvs
      (setenv CVSROOT /afs/cs/project/coda-src/cvs or 
       export CVSROOT=/afs/cs/project/coda-src/cvs)
   b) cvs checkout doc will produce your workspace in a subdirectory
      doc which cvs creates (watch it!!!)
   c) do your work: make sure the formatting works before checking
      in. 
   d) commit the work with cvs commit . in the doc directory.

2. For formatting, use a Linux box such as lesbos which has the
linuxdoc-sgml package installed.  In principle:
   a) making HTML: sgml2html filename
   b) making a dvi file: sgml2latex -d manual.sgml
   c) making a man page: sgml2txt -man cfs.sgml

3. We have scripts in the scripts directory which can make all manual
pages.  Please be very careful in modifying the perl scripts.



Things to do:
=============

Roy, Josh:
----------
 - finish off the Coda User Manual.  It's 95% there, but needs proofreading and
some minor modifications to the sgml files 
 - include the internals/admin/advanced-sysad.txt into the manual

Peter & Roy:
------------
 - Find a mechanism to add the man pages to manuals as well as having
them standalone.
 - Deal with bibliographies

Clement:
--------
 - Finish off the RVM manual: Like the above but its' only 80% there
 - Add your internals documentation component to this (and add
yourself to the list of authors). 

Peter:
------
 - Set up Makefiles
 - Edit Lily & my write back document and add it.
 - Add more internals documents
 - Improve DTD and filters.
 - Get the stuff on the WWW
 - Collect useful resources on the Coda WWW pages.

Josh
----
 - Add the backup design documents to the tree under internals/backup.
