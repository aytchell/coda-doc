<Chapt>Adding New Kinds of Side Effects<P>
<label id="SideEffects">

This chapter is not intended for the average user.  
Rather, it is meant for a system programmer who intends
to add support for a new kind of side effect.
To do this, the system programmer must do the following:
<enum>
Define an appropriate side effect descriptor, add it to the header file se.h and to the discriminated union in the
definition of SE_Descriptor.

Define an appropriate Initializer structure and a corresponding component in the SE_Initializer
structure in file se.h.

Write a set of routines corresponding to each of the SE_XXX routines described in the following pages.
This includes a SE_Activate() routine to enlarge the table in file se.c,  and a SE_SetDefaults() routine to
deal with SE_Initializer structures.
</enum>


<sect>Usage Notes<p>
<enum>
You will modify two RPC2 files (se.h and se.c), and add one more file
containing the code implementing your new side effect.
Also modify the Makefile to compile and link in your new file. 

Client and server programs will cause the appropriate side effect routines
to be linked in by calling the appropriate
SE_Activate() for each side effect they are interested in.
Note that these calls must precede @RPC(Init)().

None of these procedures will be called for a connection, if the 
RPC2_Bind that created the connection specified NULL for the
SideEffectType parameter.
	
In each of the calls, ConnHandle is the handle identifying the connection
on which the side effect is desired.  It is not likely to be a small
integer.  Since you cannot access the internal data structures of the
RPC2 runtime system, you cannot use this for much.
It is passed to you primarily for identification.
	
You can use RPC2_GetSEPointer() and RPC2_SetSEPointer() to
associate per-connection side effect data structures.
	
Use RPC2_GetPeerInfo)() to get the identity of a connections peer.

Three return codes:RPC2_SUCCESS and RPC2_SEFAIL1 and RPC2_SEFAIL2 are
recognized for each of the calls.
The successful return causes the RPC runtime system to resume normal
execution from the point at which the side effect routine 
was invoked. The failure returns abort the call at that point and returns
RPC2_SEFAIL1 or RPC_SEFAIL2 to the client
or server code that invoked the RPC system call.
RPC2_SEFAIL1 is an error, but not a fatal error.
Future RPC calls on this connection will still work.
RPC2_SEFAIL2 is a fatal error.

	The call is made just after the connection is successfully established, before control is returned
	to the caller. BindTime is the amount of time the bind took because of the network. 
        If SE_Bind2) returns RPC2_SEFAIL1) or RPC2_SEFAIL2, that code is returned as the

  <sect2>Description:<p>
	Called after a request has been completely filled, just prior to network
    ordering of header fields, encryption and transmission.
    You may use the Prefix information to determine the actual size of the 
    buffer corresponding to *RequestPtr.  If you add data, 
    remember to update the BodyLength field of the header in *RequestPtr.
    You also probably wish to update the SideEffectFlags and
    SideEffectDataOffset fields of the header.
    SDesc points to the side effect descriptor passed in by the client.

    If you need more space than available in the buffer passed to you, you may 
    allocate a larger packet, copy the current contents and add additional data.
    Return a pointer to the packet you allocated in RequestPtr: this is the packet
    that will actually get sent over the wire.  DO NOT free the buffer pointed to
    by RequestPtr initially.  If you allocate a packet, it will be freed immediately
    after successful transmission.

	    ordering of header fields.
	    Examine the SideEffectFlags and SideEffectDataOffset fields to

	    Reply.  If you remove data,
	    remember to update the BodyLength field of the header in Reply.
	    SDesc points to the side effect descriptor.
	    You will probably wish to fill in the status fields of this descriptor.  
	    If the MakeRPC call fails for some reason, this routine will be called with
	    a Reply of NULL.  This allows you to take suitable cleanup action.
