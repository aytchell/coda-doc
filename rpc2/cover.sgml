<abstract>
  This manual describes the programming interface and internal design of
  <em>RPC2</em>, a highly portable and extensible remote procedure call
  package for Unix. RPC2 runs on top of the IP/UDP protocol, and provides
  support for streaming file transfer, parallel RPC calls, and IP-level
  multicast.  The manual also describes two other packages used by RPC2:
  <em>RP2Gen</em>, a stub generator, and <em>LWP</em>, a coroutine-based
  lightweight process package.  All the software described in this manual
  runs at user-level on the Unix 4.3BSD interface; no kernel modifications
  are necessary.  The software has been ported to a variety of machine
  architectures (such as IBM-RT, MIPS, Sun2, Sun3, Sparc, and i386) and to
  variants of the Unix operating system (such as Mach, SunOS and AIX).
