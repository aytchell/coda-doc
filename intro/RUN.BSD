CODA IS BARELY READY FOR PRODUCTION USE. THIS RELEASE IS JUST FOR
THOSE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THOSE FEATURES WHICH WORK. IT CONTAINS
KERNEL CODE, AND SERVERS RUNNING WITH ROOT PRIVILEGES, AND COULD LEAD
TO DATA LOSS.

III.	Venus -- the client

1. Initializing before running Venus:

The venus-setup script does all the hard work, it will setup the coda
control files, create /dev/cfs0 to communicate with the kernel, ...

venus-setup <comma_separated_host_list> <cache_size_in_kb>

We strongly recommend that you try testserver.coda.cs.cmu.edu as the
<comma_separated_host_list> first. 

NOTE:
The cache size should be at least 10Meg, typically 60-100Meg is used
(ie. 60000 or 100000 on the above line).  DO NOT GO ABOVE 100Meg.
NOTE:
venus-setup will edit /etc/services to add some additional services.)
NOTE:
YOU MUST HAVE A KERNEL ENABLED WITH VENUS SUPPORT TO PROCEED.

2. Running Venus:

The following assumes you are running X-Window.  However, you could
run these commands from NetBSD's virtual consoles as well, but
omitting the "xterm -e" in front of the commands below.

Start Venus with
	venus -init &

The init flag is only given the first time venus is started.  It flushes
the local cache contents.  (Actually, the first time venus is started
or whenever venus is connected to a different server.)

Observe the venus log with
	xterm -e tail -f /usr/coda/etc/console
It will tell you when venus has started and give status.

Type 
    xterm -e codacon &
to see the communications between the kernel and Venus.


NOTE:
Please make sure your have enough free space on the filesystem in
which /usr/coda/venus.cache resides for the cachesize indicated.  That
is, if you specify 20000 for for twenty-thousand kilobytes, this means
you must have at least 20MB of free on the partition containing
venus.cache.

See below how to point your client at your own server.

IV.	Codasrv -- the server

1. Initializing before running Vice:

NOTE: that running a server seriously dips into your virtual memory.
Running a server _and_ a client and X11 needs slightly over 64M of
available VM.

To set up an SCM server, you need to have the following available: 
  1)	an empty directory ( /vicepa ) where the fileserver will
	put files.
  2)	a raw partition for RVM metadata (you can use a file but it 
	will be quite slow on a decent size server). This partition
	must be around 4% of the total size of the files you wish 
	to store under /vicepa (e.g. on a 2GB server we use around
	80M of rvm data). Consider 10M to be the minimum. 
  3)	a LOG partition, preferably on a disk by itself. This 
	needs not be large. 
  4)	two secret tokens of _exactly_ 8 characters (eg elephant).

The RVM files involve the journalling/transactional aspects of Coda.

Then run:
     vice-setup

and answer its questions.

2. Running Vice:

Start the update server, client and the auth server, as well as the
fileserver by typing:

	/usr/pkg/etc/rc.vice start

Now observe the log:
	xterm -e tail -f  /vice/srv/SrvLog & 

Determine with ps that codasrv, updatesrv and updateclnt are running.
The SrvLog should show "File Server started".  If not, you have a
problem.

3: Making Volumes

Make a root volume (coda:root [below] should be the name you gave to
vice-setup for the root volume name): 

	createvol_rep coda:root E0000100 /vicepa

NOTE:
E0000100 is the Volume Storage Group set up for you by
vice-setup. With more servers you can define other groups in
/vice/db/VSGDB -- see the Coda User Manual.

Now you are ready to point a Venus (client) at this server. 

The vice-setup program installed an administrative user on the server,
named admin.  It needs to have uid: 500 and has been assigned password
changeme.  Read section 7.7 in the Coda Manual to find out how to set
up another user and password database (such users must be installed on
clients too, but need not be in /etc/passwd on the servers).

V. Common Tasks

1. Normal server startup:
	startserver &

it comes up at boot time from rc.vice, unless you said "No" to
automatic startup, OR if the there is a file /vice/srv/CRASH exists,
which indicates the fileserver crashed. Howver you need the update
server and client for system administration and the authserver for
authentication -- see /usr/pkg/etc/rc.vice.

2. Re-run venus-setup and point your server to your own server.

* make sure the server is up _AND_ you have made root volumes*
Do a venus-setup and use your own server as the
<comma_separated_host_list>

start venus with 
     venus -init &
     xterm -e tail -f /usr/coda/venus.cache/venus.log
     xterm -e tail -f /usr/coda/etc/console
     xterm -e codacon

When the server is up cd to /coda and start playing.  You won't run
-init the next time you start venus.  The flag is necessary in this
case since we are switching the server venus is talking to.
(Currently, venus does not support Cells.)


3. Restarting a server:

     volutil shutdown
shuts down the server.  Restart as above.

4. Restarting a client.

The official procedure is to:
	vutil -shutdown

kill -9 <venus> works equally well.  Then restart as stated above.

If ps aux | grep venus displays a Zombie venus, you will probably need
to reboot your machine before trying again.

5. Troubleshooting.

a) If the server crashes before you have used it through /coda, do rm
-rf /vice and start all over. At the minimum you must do before you
restart.

Remember: first clean, then startserver, then make rootvolumes.

b) If venus comes up but hangs or crashes, check for zombie venus
processes. If these exist, reboot first.
