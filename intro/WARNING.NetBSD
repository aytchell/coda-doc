	This is release 4.6.5 of the Coda FileSystem.

NOTE:
	We run mostly NetBSD 1.3 locally and not 1.3H.  There might be
differences between 1.3 and -current that will materially effect Coda;
we do not stress Coda heavily with 1.3H.

IMPORTANT:
	The package system is broken in -current and won't pkg_add
either the server pkg or client pkg provided.  We have supplied a
1.3 pkg_add which does work.
