This HOWTO should give you help in answering vice-setup questions.
</abstract>

<toc>

<sect> Explanation <p>
In the text that follows:
indented sections are used to indicate what the <tt/vice-setup/ program
printed out,
<tt/``''/ encloses text that was
typed as a response, and
<em>italics are used to add commentary and explanation</em>.
<tscreen><verb>root. ``/vice-setup''
Setting up config files (under /vice).
Directories under /vice are set up.
</verb></tscreen>
<em>NOTE: The server control files are stored under /vice.</em>
<tscreen><verb>Setting up tokens for authentication.
The following tokens must be identical on all servers.
Enter a random token for auth2 authentication : ``aaaaaaaa''
The following tokens must be identical on all servers.
Enter a random token for volutil authentication : ``bbbbbbbb''
tokens done!
</verb></tscreen>
<em>Obviously, you need better password than these.  But nothing else
during vice-setup will ask for them so you probably should write
them down.</em>

<tscreen><verb>Setting up the file list for update
filelist for update ready.
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>Populating /vice/vol...
lockfiles created.
/etc/services already has new services registered! Good.
/etc/services ready for Coda
Do you want to start the server at boot time? (y/n) ``n''
Is this the master server, aka the SCM machine? (y/n) ``y''
Now installing files specific to the SCM...
</verb></tscreen>
<em>Don't ask about SCM's the answer is yes!  You might or might not
want to start codasrv when you boot -- your choice. </em>
<tscreen><verb>Setting up servers file.
Enter an id for this server (a number > 0 < 255) : ``3''
</verb></tscreen>
<em>Any single u_char is good here.  The number appears much later in
the /vice/vol/VRList.  It is just a way to identify particular servers.
</em>
<tscreen><verb>
done!
Initializing the VSGDB to contain the SCM as E0000100
/vice/db/VSGDB set up
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>Setting up ROOTVOLUME file
Enter the name of the rootvolume (< 32 chars) : ``gluck.root''
</verb></tscreen>
<em>&lt;Server name&gt;.root is a good choice.</em>
<tscreen><verb>Setting up users and groups for Coda
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>You need to give me a nonzero uid of a user on this system,
who will be a Coda System:Administrator member,
(sort of a Coda super user)
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>Enter the uid of this user:``1234''
</verb></tscreen>
<em>Since you are playing here you most probably want to choose your
uid and user name.</em>
<tscreen><verb>[: V.: unknown operand
1 user entries found
An initial administrative user <you> (id 1234) with Coda password changeme now exists.
</verb></tscreen>

<em>
What needs to be done next is that you need to set up the data space
for your server.  Ultimately, you will provide a directory where the
server will keep its files.  But first you need space for the metadata
that the server uses.  As discussed elsewhere, the metadata is kept in
a scheme that we call RVM.  There are two components to RVM: the real
data and a log file (because rvm is a database-like scheme).  We will
ask for this data in the reverse order to what was described.
</em>
<tscreen><verb>You need a small log disk partition, preferrably on a disk by itself.
You need a metadata partition of approx 4% of you filespace.
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>For trial purposes you may give ordinary files instead of raw
partitions. Keep all size small if you do this.
Production servers will want partitions for speed.
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>
-------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: you are going to play with your partitions now.
verify all answers you give.
-------------------------------------------------------
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>
WARNING: these choices are not easy to change once you are up and running.
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>
Are you ready to set up RVM? [yes/no] ``yes''
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>
What is your log partition? ``/dev/rsd0h''
</verb></tscreen>
<em/This can also be a file./
<tscreen><verb>
The log size must be smaller than you log partition.
We recommend not more than 30M log size, and 2M is a good choice.
What is your log size? (enter as e.g. '12M') ``2M''
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>
What is your data partition (or file)? ``/vicepa/DATA''
</verb></tscreen>
<em>Here we are using a file, but we could also have used a raw
partition if we had one spare.
</em>
<tscreen><verb>
The data size must be approx 4% of you server file space.
We have templates for servers of approx: 500M, 1G, 2.2G, 3.3G, 8G
(you can store less, but not more on such servers).
The corresponding data sizes are  22M, 44M, 90M, 130M, 315M.
(use 330M only on very fast machines)
Pick one of the defaults, otherwise I will bail out
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>
What is the size of you data partition (or file) [22M,44M, 90M, 130M, 315M]: ``44M''
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>
--------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: DATA and LOG partitions are about to be wiped.

</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>
  --- log area: /dev/rsd0h, size 2M.
  --- data area: /vicepa/DATA, size 44M.
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>
Proceed, and wipe out old data? [y/N] ``y''
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>
LOG file has been initialized!
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>Rdsinit will initialize data and log.
This takes a while.
rvm_initialize succeeded.
Going to initialize data file to zero, could take awhile.
done.

Just mapped in region (50000000,37748736)
Just mapped in region (52400000,1048576)
rds_zap_heap completed successfully.
rvm_terminate succeeded.
RVM setup is done!
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>
Your server directories will hold the files (not directories).
You can currently only have one directory per disk partition.
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>
Where shall we store your data [/vicepa]? ``/vicepa''
mkdir: /vicepa: File exists
Shall I set up a vicetab entry for approx 256000 files for /vicepa (y/n) ``y''
grep: /vice/db/vicetab: No such file or directory
Now initializing the partition. This takes a while....
Partition /vicepa: inodes in use: 0, total: 262144.

Congratulations: your configuration is ready...and now
to get going do the following:
 - start the auth2 server as: auth2
 - start rpc2portmap as: rpc2portmap
 - start updateclnt as:  updateclnt -h gluck.coda.cs.cmu.edu -q coda_udpsrv
 - start updatesrv as: updatesrv -p /vice/db
 - start the fileserver: startserver &
    echo  - wait until the server is up: tail -f /vice/srv/SrvLog
    echo  - create your root volume: createvol_rep gluck.root E0000100 /vicepa
 - setup a client: venus-setup gluck.coda.cs.cmu.edu 20000
 - start venus: venus
 - enjoy Coda.
