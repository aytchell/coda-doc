Coda is being polished and rewritten where necessary.  Coda is a work
in progress and does have bugs.  It is, though, very usable.

			========
			WARNING: 
			========

CODA IS BARELY READY FOR PRODUCTION USE. THIS RELEASE IS JUST FOR
THOSE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THOSE FEATURES WHICH WORK. IT CONTAINS
KERNEL CODE, AND SERVERS RUNNING WITH ROOT PRIVILIGES, AND COULD LEAD
TO DATA LOSS.

And of course, your bug reports (and even fixes) would be appreciated.

			========
			NOTES:
			========

If the client (venus) reports:

		Connection Timedout

when accessing a file, this means that venus thinks the server has
crashed.  Venus does not have the file cached locally and it can not
get it.  You should log in to the server (vice) machine and look at

		/vice/srv/SrvErr
		/vice/srv/SrvLog

If the client (venus) hangs when accessing a file and/or "ls /coda"
hangs, then venus itself has probably crashed.  Look at the logs

		/usr/coda/etc/console
		/usr/coda/venus.cache/venus.log
